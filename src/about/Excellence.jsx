                Business Excellence and Quality Management
            </h1>
            <p>
                We are committed to operations excellence and have had an ongoing Business Excellence activity for the
                IANA functions since 2009. We are pleased to have received EFQM Committed to Excellence recognition for
                these departments following an assessment conducted by a panel of three independent assessors in August
                2013.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded in 1989, EFQM (the European Foundation for Quality Management) is the not-for-profit membership
                foundation that publishes the EFQM Excellence Model, a comprehensive management framework used by over
                30,000 organizations around the world. The model helps organizations achieve and sustain outstanding
                levels of performance that meet or exceed the expectations of all their stakeholders. It allows people
                to understand the cause and effect relationships between what their organization does and the results it
                achieves.
            </p>
            <p>
                The model is based on the Fundamental Concepts of Excellence:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Adding value for customers
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating a sustainable future
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developing organizational capability
                </li>
                <li>
                    Harnessing creativity and innovation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leading with vision, inspiration and integrity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Managing with agility
                </li>
                <li>
                    Succeeding through the talent of people
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sustaining outstanding results
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Fundamental Concepts of Excellence form the basis for the criteria of the EFQM Excellence Model.
            </p>
            <p>
                We engaged EFQM to perform the assessment and will use the analysis to identify improvements. We remain
                committed to using the EFQM model to perform continual review and improvement of the IANA services we
                provide to the community.
